### Deleting Posted Sale or Purchase Invoices
In case you get the message `Allow Document Deletion Before must have a value in Sales & Receivables Setup: Primary Key=. It cannot be zero or empty.` then [read this page](https://community.dynamics.com/forums/thread/details/?threadid=7c837ce0-c9ed-4818-844f-4219c04e898d)
and put in a date that is far far away in the future     

**please remember that deleting an invoice will remove only the invoice .. any posted ledger entries will remain and not be reversed**      

this is done by design .. you can delete invoice if you want .. the ledger entries stay.
