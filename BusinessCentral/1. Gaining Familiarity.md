4. **Creating New Companies / Deleting old ones** 
    - In Business Central search for Companies and then in that list add or delete companies. You can only do this if you are assigned the SUPER permission set. 
    - An alternative way of creating companies is ```My Settings->3 dot ellipsis next to Company->3 dot Ellipsis on Top-> New```    
5. **Setting up Number Series (for invoices etc.)** 
    - in Business Central search for `No. series`    
    - remember to check boxes that allow `Default No.s`, `Manual No.s` and `Allow Gaps in No.s`    
6. **VAT issues in posting AP/AR**    
    - Business Central expects each GL Account or Item on which a purchase or sales invoice is issued to have their own specific tax setup and VAT setup
    - So you need to setup VAT at the account/item level as well as the customer / vendor level    
    - After that yo need to do the Tax Setup (search for Tax Setup)

    - [link here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-object-specifications-limitations)
